## What is this ?

Darkly is a ISO Web CyberSecurity 42 project. A ISO file is given that contains a running website.

The Website is vulnerable to a total of 14 different breaches documented by [The OWASP Foundation](https://owasp.org). Each breach is cataloged in a folder that matches its name, containing the flag associated with it and a writeup with a possible mitigation strategy.

**For your enjoyment, if you are a 42 student and you haven't completed this project,**

**DO NOT READ THE SOLUTIONS! THIS PROJECT IS BEST DONE BLIND!**
